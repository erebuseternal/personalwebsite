    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <h3><code>profx</code>: In a Few Words</h3>
    <p>
      <code>profx</code> is quite simply a series of classes designed to make building http
      servers incredibly simple. And the way it does this is by providing you with
      a few central components: a http request object, a http response object, a
      http resource (more on that in a second), and then a server protocol and factory.
      These objects in and of themselves are powerful, but their real power (in my
      unbiased opinion) is how they fit together.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <code>profx</code> everything that you do centers around implementing resources.
      A resource is a special class which gets sent http request objects from your
      server and generates an http response object. Your server can have one or many
      of these resources and each resource is added to your server factory with a simple
      method. When you add a resource, you also supply a path at the same time. This
      path is very important. Here's why. Every time your server gets a request from some client
      it will parse out the url's path.  It will then look through the paths that
      you have entered with each resource and find the path that best matches (if
      there is one), where a match is better if it is more specific. For example
      if we have the url path <code>/boston/docs/page.html</code> and we have
      resource 1 attached to the path <code>/boston/</code>, resource 2 attached to
      the path <code>/boston/docs/</code>, and resource 3 attached to the path
      <code>/newyork/</code>, then resources 1 and 2 will both match (3 won't)
      but resource 2 will be chosen because its path is more specific. If
      resource 2 had been attached to the path <code>/boston/images/</code> it
      wouldn't have matched at all and so resource 1 would have been chosen.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way <code>profx</code> allows you to create resources which create
      responses however you want and attaches them to specific url paths, therefore
      holding true to the nature of HTTP.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, for anyone who is familiar with <code>twisted</code> you know that there
      is a resource based server factory and resource classes in twisted already.
      So why have I done all of this? This brings us to the other strength of
      <code>profx</code>. With <code>profx</code>, unlike <code>twisted</code>'s
      version of the same thing, within the resource class you have complete
      and easy access to the entire request that you are now responding too.
      This means you can look at things like cookies (which is actually the main
      reason I wrote all this stuff).
    </p>
    <p>
      So <code>profx</code> is a resource based server that gives you complete and
      easy access to all parts of the requests you handle while also taking advantage
      of the power <code>twisted</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So now that we have an overview of <code>profx</code>, let's look at the details.
      We will start with the message objects, the go to the resource class, and finally
      look at the server protocol and factory.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h1>Message Objects</h1>
    <p>
      First of all, there is a lot more to the message objects than I am going
      to go through here. What I am going to tell you is how <i>you</i> can
      read request objects and how <i>you</i> can create response objects. But
      there is a lot more to these objects, all of which aids the server in handling
      them, turning them into real http messages, and reading in requests.
    </p>
    <h3>Reading Requests</h3>
    <p>
      So the first thing you are going to need to know when writing up you resources
      is how to read http request objects (which I am just going to refer to as
      requests from now on).
    </p>
    <p>
      In short to each request there are a number of attributes, each which holds
      an object representing the particular piece of the request. The attributes
      you'll want to access are the following ones:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>version</code></li>
      <li><code>headers</code></li>
      <li><code>header_names</code></li>
      <li><code>body</code></li>
      <li><code>has_body</code></li>
      <li><code>url</code></li>
      <li><code>method</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Let's go through each of these in turn.
    </p>
    <h4><code>version</code></h4>
    <p>
      The <code>version</code> attribute returns a <code>Version</code> object.
    </p>
    <p>
      What do you need to know about this object? You can access the version number
      at the <code>number</code> attribute of any one of these objects. That and
      the default is 1.1.
    </p>
    <h4><code>headers</code></h4>
    <p>
      The <code>headers</code> attribute returns a list of <code>Header</code> objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of these <code>Header</code> objects has an attribute <code>name</code>
      which is the name of the particular header, and an attribute <code>values</code>
      which is a list containing all of the values that header had in the request
      message (even if it was just one).
    </p>
    <h4><code>header_names</code></h4>
    <p>
      The <code>header_names</code> attribute returns a list containing all of the
      names of the headers in your request object. This is useful for quickly
      check to see if a particular header is in headers.
    </p>
    <h4><code>body</code></h4>
    <p>
      The <code>body</code> attribute returns a the body of your request message
      if there was one and '' if not.
    </p>
    <h4><code>has_body</code></h4>
    <p>
      The <code>has_body</code> attribute is simply a boolean that lets you know
      if the request has a body.
    </p>
    <h4><code>url</code></h4>
    <p>
      The <code>url</code> attribute has a <code>Url</code> object attached to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The url object has a series of attributes all corresponding to a part of
      the request url. Each of the following named things is an attribute of the url:
    </p>
    <p class="code">
      <code>[scheme:][[//][username:password@]host[:port]][path][?query][#fragment]
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>
      So for example you can access the path using <code>Url.path</code>. All of these
      pieces are by default <code>None</code> if not specified by the request.
    </p>
    <h4><code>method</code></h4>
    <p>
      The <code>method</code> attribute has a <code>Method</code> object attached to
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This object has a <code>method</code> attribute which holds the method name
      in string form. This name will be all caps.
    </p>
    <p>
      And with that you can access all parts of the request you could every want!
    </p>
    <h3>Creating Responses</h3>
    <p>
      First I should note that with the exception of the <code>url</code> and the
      <code>method</code> attributes, all of the above attributes are available to
      you in the response object. <code>version</code> defaults to a <code>Version</code>
      object with number 1.1, <code>headers</code> and <code>header_names</code> default
      to empty lists, <code>body</code> defaults to an empty string, and <code>has_body</code>
      defaults to <code>False</code>. <b>Only use these attributes to check what you have
      already done, don't use them to set things!</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      To create a response object you first must initialize a <code>profx.httpmessage.Response</code>
      object. The constructor for this object takes no inputs.
    </p>
    <p>
      On initialization the response object will have a <code>Status</code> object
      assigned to it with a status code of 200. Don't worry, you can change this if you
      want.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that you have initialized the object you are going to want to set the response's
      various attributes. You can do this with the following methods (all of which
      are attached to the response object).
    </p>
    <h4><code>SetStatus</code></h4>
    <p>
      You can input a <code>Status</code> object into <code>SetStatus</code> to set
      the status code and message of your response. A <code>profx.httpmessage.Status</code> object is
      initialized with a number as input. This number is your status' code. Note
      that you do not provide the message; this will be done automatically for you.
    </p>
    <h4><code>SetVersion</code></h4>
    <p>
      You can input a <code>Version</code> object into <code>SetVersion</code> to set
      the version of your response message. A <code>profx.httpmessage.Version</code>
      object is initialized with a float (of the form a.b) that is the version number
      you want to use (default is 1.1).
    </p>
    <h4><code>AddHeader</code></h4>
    <p>
      You can input a <code>Header</code> object into <code>AddHeader</code> to
      add the header to the list of headers.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <code>profx.httpmessage.Header</code> object is initialized with a
      name and an optional value. If you add the value it will be the first element
      in your values list.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can add an additional values with <code>SetValue</code> which just takes
      your values as input.
    </p>
    <h4><code>SetBody</code></h4>
    <p>
      You can input a string into <code>SetBody</code> to add a body to your
      response; note that this will automatically set <code>has_body</code> to
      <code>True</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      And with that you can control everything in your response.
    </p>
    <p>
      For testing purposes, if you want to see what you response looks like
      in http message form, just call the <code>Write</code> method on your
      response object (without any inputs)
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h1>Resources</h1>
    <p>
      Now that we have an idea about how to deal with requests and responses we can
      move onto resources. To reiterate, a resource is a special class which has
      a method that takes in a request and produces a response. The special class we
      are talking about is <code>profx.httpresource.ServerResource</code>: every
      resource class you create <i>must</i> inherit from this class. When you
      create such a resource class there is only one thing that you must do: instantiate
      the <code>CreateResponse</code> method. This method takes self and a request
      object as its two inputs and <i>must</i> return a response object. Finally
      besides the attributes you set on the resource, and the attributes in the request
      object, you can take of the <code>path</code> attribute on every resource.
      This will be set to the path you couple with the resource when you register
      the resource with your server.
    </p>
    <p>
      So to summarize, a resource is class inheriting from <code>profx.httpresource.ServerResource</code>
      in which you instantiate a <code>CreateResponse(self, request)</code> method
      which <i>must</i> return a response object. Within this method, by default, you
      have access to the request object and a <code>path</code> attribute containing the
      path you registered the resource under.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that <code>ServerResource</code> does not have a special constructor defined
      so you can define your own constructor for your own resource class.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h1>Server Protocol</h1>
    <p>
      The server protocol is quite simple. But I am just going to go over it so you
      can better understand how your server should act.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simply put a protocol deals with a single connection. (Therefore every time
      someone connects to your server, one of these is generated to handle
      the connection).It first reads the
      request message and parses it into a request object. Then it reads the url
      path and then finds the best match in the paths you have registered with your
      server. If nothing is found it returns a 404 message (more on that in a moment)
      but if something is found, it gets the resource attached to the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next thing it does is rather important. Rather than calling the resource's
      <code>CreateResponse</code> right there, it passes the method call (with the
      request object to input) to a <code>twisted Deferred</code> generated by throwing
      the method call to a new thread. This means that if you resource is expensive
      (in terms of time) that it will not impact someone else's connection to your
      server, unless you just have that many connections and then other difficulties
      arise. (But I would suggest using a reverse proxy to solve this problem).
    </p>
    <p>
      When <code>CreateResponse</code> does finally return, the server protocol will
      be called on to send the message and close the connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      If at any point there is some kind of error (for example you didn't return a
      response) the server protocol will send a 500 message back to the client.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the server will by default use general (and really boring) 404 and
      500 http body. If you want something more interesting you can register error
      pages with the server factory, and the server protocol will use the ones for
      404 and 500. (In fact these are the only ones that will be ever used, because,
      as far as errors, the server protocol can only not find anything or throw an error)
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h1>Server Factory</h1>
    <p>
      Phew! almost done. We have finally come to the server factory. This is where
      everything comes together. The class that you will be instantiating is the
      <code>profx.SwitchFactory</code>. Its constructor doesn't take any arguments
      so that bit is easy. There are two things you can do to this factory before
      sending it on its merry way: register a resource and add an error page.
    </p>
    <p>
      To register a resource, take the instance of the resource class you want to register
      and the path you want to register your resource under, and pass them, in
      that order, into your factory's <code>RegisterResource</code> method. That's it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Note thought that when you input a path, if it does not have a trailing /
      the server factory will add it before registering the resource. This is
      to keep things consistent and therefore easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      To add an error page take the error code of the page (either 404 or 500)
      and the path of the html page on your machine and pass them, in that order,
      to your factory's <code>AddErrorPage</code> method.
    </p>
    <p>
      With those two pieces you can completely configure your server.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>
      Okay, so let's summarize all of that. To use <code>profx</code> you must
      create your resource classes, instantiate the specific ones you want to
      use, and register them with an instance of <code>profx.SwitchFactory</code>
      under their especial paths, and then add some error pages for the server to use
      if the default ones just aren't working for you. With that you have, packaged
      in your factory, your whole server.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h1>Deployment</h1>
    <p>
      This is where my work ends, but it would be really dumb if I told you how to
      create your server but never how to deploy it. When it comes to deployment
      you essentially have two options. The <code>twisted reactor</code> or daemonization
      using <code>twistd</code>.
    </p>
    <h3>The Reactor</h3>
    <p>
      To use the reactor simply use the following lines of code:
    </p>
    <p class="code">
      <code>
        from twisted.internet import reactor</br>
        reactor.listenTCP([port#], factory)</br>
        reactor.run()
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>
      where [port#] should be replaced with the port you want your server to listen
      for connections on (usually 80 for http servers)
    </p>
    <p>
      The you can run the thing by just running your code like any normal python script.
    </p>
    <h3>Daemonization</h3>
    <p>
      To daemonize your server (which I greatly suggest look to <code>twisted</code>'s
      documentation for why) put the following lines in a file with a .tac extension.
    </p>
    <p class="code">
      <code>
        from twisted.application import internet, service</br>
        application = service.Application('[name of your application]')</br>
        staticService = internet.TCPServer([port#], factory)</br>
        staticService.setServiceParent(application)
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>
      where [port#] should be replaced with the port you want your server to listen
      for connections on (usually 80 for http servers), and [name of your application]
      is just a string you want to use as the name for your application.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this file was named server.tac then to run the server you would run:
    </p>
    <p class="code">
      <code>
        twistd -y server.tac
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This will generate a pid file in the same directry as server.tac, which
      has the pid of your server application. This is insanely useful for killing
      your application cleanly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Congrats! That is profx.
