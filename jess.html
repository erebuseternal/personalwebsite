    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <h3><code>jess</code>: In a Few Words</h3>
    <p>
      All scrapers have two layers, the layer which extracts data from individual
      pages, and the layer which controls moving through many pages. <code>jess</code> is concerned
      with the former. <code>jess</code> uses the fact that many web pages are structured around the css used to style
      them to create a web page scraping class class which is incredibly easy to configure and
      extremely flexible.
    </p>
    <h3>How it Works: Big Picture</h3>
    <p>
      At a high level, the process <code>jess</code> uses to scrape a page is the following:
      <code>jess</code> consumes a configuration file, which tells <code>jess</code> how to construct keys and values
      from the html page. The configuration file is composed of rules attached to CSS selectors.
      For each selector,
      <code>jess</code> grabs all of the tags satisfying to that selector and applies the corresponding rules
      to each tag to create a single key and, optionally, a value. These keys and values
      are stored in a dictionary composed of those keys and, for each key, a list of the values
      assigned
      to that key.
    </p>
    <p>
      To use <code>jess</code> the user creates the aforementioned configuration file and
      the functions that will be used to extract data from individual tags. <code>jess</code> will
      then use these two components to extract data from the entire page.
      Once the user has given both of these parts to <code>jess</code>' <code>Action</code> class, as well as the page to be
      scraped, it only takes a single method call for <code>jess</code> to have the page scraped and in key value form.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h1>The Configuration</h1>
    <p>
      The configuration file is the place where you
      tell jess how it is you would like to create keys and values from your page(s).
      Now, since the advent of CSS more and more web pages are structured, in meaningful ways,
      around the hooks CSS uses to style them. The reason for this is clear, documents present
      structure in their content in a visual manner and therefore the hooks that CSS uses
      correlate strongly to the structure of the document. Therefore they are a great place
      upon which to hinge the scraping of a web page. As such the configuration file is composed
      of a set of CSS selector and declaration blocks of the form:
    </p>
    <p class="code">
      <code>
        selector {</br>
        &nbsp;rule1;</br>
        &nbsp;rule2;</br>
        }
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>
      The selector is simply a CSS selector which will identify tags on an html page. To learn
      more about them go <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_syntax.asp">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rules in each block have the following form:
    </p>
    <p class="code">
      <code>
        type: how;
      </code>
    </p>
    <h3>The Type Portion</h3>
    <p>
      The type is either key or val, and the how is a what identifies
      the way in which we wish to generate the corresponding
      key or value. For each CSS block we must have exactly one rule with the type key
      and can optionally have at most one rule with a val type.
      What these blocks represent is how to create the key and (optionally) value for
      any html tag that satisfies the selector at the beginning of the block. For any tag
      satisfying that selector these are the functions that will create the key and
      (optionally) value for that tag.
    </p>
    <h3>The 'How' Portion</h3>
    <p>
      Concerning the 'how' portion of each of the rules, it breaks into two types:
      a function reference, or a tag reference.
    </p>
    <h4>The Function Reference</h4>
    <p>
      A function reference is simply a string (no spaces and not starting with the string 'get')
      that identifies a function in you yourself have written. We will return to this later. Suffice it
      to say that the function we are referencing will be used on each of the tags
      the selector of our block identifies to create the corresponding key or value.
    </p>
    <h4>The Tag Reference</h4>
    <p>
      The other option is a tag reference. These can only be used for rules of the key type. It has the following
      form:
    </p>
    <p class="code">
      <code>
        get(selector[direction])
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>
      selector here is a css selector (for which there must be a block already in
      your code) and [direction] is one of ^, <, >. What this 'how' indicates is that <code>jess</code>
      should start at the current
      tag found by this block's selector, look
      for the first tag satisfying the selector in the direction specified by [direction],
      get its key, and assign that key to the current tag. The directions specified by ^, <,
      and > are up, left, and right respectively. Up means look at the current tag's parent and
      siblings, then at its grandparent and its siblings, and so forth and so on. Left means look
      for the current tag's siblings moving up the html page, and right means look for the current
      tag's siblings moving down the html page. All
      of this is extremely useful if you want to do something like make the content of
      a paragraph a value and set its key to be the text of the previous header tag.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a final note on the use of this feature, <code>jess</code> will go through your css blocks in order.
      Therefore, if you ask to use a key for a tag which only satisfies a selector which
      is further down on your list of css blocks than your current selector's block, jess
      will throw an error. This is because the key for that tag hasn't actually been created
      yet and so there is nothing to grab.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h1>The Extraction Functions</h1>
    <h3>A Note</h3>
    <p>
      Before we can talk about the extraction functions, there is another thing
      that needs to be pointed out.
      <code>jess</code> does not work with html directly, rather it works with a BeautifulSoup soup object
      generated from the html you want to scrape. (To read about how to create a
      soup object go <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">here</a>)
      Therefore when you eventually input your page, it
      will be input as soup.
    </p>
    <h3>The Functions</h3>
    <p>
      Extraction functions then work on BeautifulSoup tags. As has been already mentioned,
      these functions are how
      you actually extract information from tags on your page(s). They
      must take, as their only input, a beautiful soup tag. Within the function you can perform
      whatever operations you want and should have it return some value (go
      <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">here</a> to
      learn how to interact with BeautifulSoup tags). (Note that if the function
      is going to return a value that will be used as a key that value
      must be a type which can be a dictionary key). For each of these functions
      you have to choose a name by which to reference the function in the configuration
      file. Then, for each function you put it in a dictionary under the name
      that you chose to reference the function by. This dictionary is what will be input
      to <code>jess</code>. When <code>jess</code> is then run on your page, whenever it finds a tag whose
      key or value is created by one of those referenced functions, it will grab the function
      from the dictionary and call it on the tag, setting the output as the corresponding
      key or value.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h1>The Action Class</h1>
    <p>
      The class that you will use to scrape pages is the <code>Action</code> class.
      This class handles parsing the rules in the configuration file, grabbing html
      tags from your page based off of the selectors in that configuration file, applying the
      corresponding rules to generate keys and values (and keeping track of keys in case
      another tag wants a previous tag's key), and placing these keys
      and values in a dictionary. All it needs is the plan of action from you (i.e.
      the configuration file) and the functions it will use to extract data (your
      extraction functions).
    </p>
    <p>
      As such, <code>Action</code>'s constructor takes as input the
      address of the configuration file on your machine, and the dictionary of functions aforementioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, once you have an <code>Action</code> class initialized, scraping everything is quite simple.
      To pass in the soup you are going to scrape, call the <code>SetVillain</code> method with your
      soup as input. Then, call <code>Act</code> with no input to scrape the document. Finally call
      <code>DumpVillain</code>
      (also with no input) to retrieve a copy of the dictionary that your <code>Action</code> produced.
      With that you are done.
      (Remember, for each key in the dictionary that results, the value corresponding
      to that key is actually the list of values assigned to that key during the scraping.)
    </p>
    <h3>Why the Weird Names?</h3>
    <p>
      Now, at this point, you are probably thinking, "what kind of method names are those?!".
      Well here's the reason for them:
    </p>
    <p>
      Scrapers are also known as Spiders, and I love Marvel Comics, so of course I decided
      to name the first versions of this code SpiderWoman. But I thought this name was
      a bit long, so I renamed it <code>jess</code> after Jessica Drew (who was SpiderWoman for a bit).
      Then, I imagined each web scrape as a battle between SpiderWoman and a Villain (the
      page to be scraped). The configuration was the plan of attack, and the
      functions were her weapons. (you can set both manually on an already configured <code>Action</code>
      instance using the <code>LoadPlan</code> and
      <code>SetWeapons</code> methods). Then she would set her sights on the villain (thus <code>SetVillain</code>),
      act out her plan of attack (thus <code>Act</code>), and finally, once she was done, dump the
      villain (thus <code>DumpVillain</code>). So that's why the names are so strange.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h1>Recap</h1>
    <p>
      So, to scrape a page:
    </p>
    <p>
      Create a configuration file to tell <code>jess</code> how it should generate keys and values
      from the page made of css blocks of the form:
    </p>
    <p class="code">
      <code>
        selector {</br>
        &nbsp;type: how;</br>
        &nbsp;type: how;</br>
        }
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>
      where you must have exactly one key rule, and at most one val rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, create the functions you have referenced in your configuration file, and
      place them in a single dictionary where the key for each function is the name
      you referenced it by in the configuration file.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, create a <code>jess.Action</code> instance with the first input being the address of
      the configuration file you wrote, and the second being the dictionary
      of functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, input the page (as soup) by calling <code>SetVillain(soup)</code> with your soup as input on
      your Action instance, Scrape
      with <code>Act()</code>, and, finally, retrieve your result with <code>DumpVillain()</code>.
